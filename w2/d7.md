Why probability is meaningless for one trade
A single trade is one realization of a random process. Probability describes long-run frequency, not individual outcomes, so it provides no actionable information for one trade.


Why probability matters only with repetition
Probability becomes meaningful only when outcomes are repeated many times, because relative frequencies stabilize as sample size increases.


Why confidence does not change probability
Probability is determined by the underlying process, not by personal belief or confidence. Changing emotions does not change outcome frequencies.


Why probability is useless for predicting tomorrow’s return
Probability is useless for predicting tomorrow’s return because a single outcome is pure noise. Probability only becomes meaningful when outcomes are repeated many times, allowing long-run frequencies to emerge.



Why it is still essential for evaluating strategies
Probability is essential in finance because strategies are evaluated over many trades, not one. It allows us to estimate the distribution of outcomes, assess risk, and judge whether a strategy has a sustainable edge over time.
