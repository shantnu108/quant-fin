random variable
a random variable is a rule that assings a number to each possible outcome of some random experiment
random outcome







Gaussian distribution = normal distribution = bell curve




A random variable is a rule that assigns numbers to uncertain outcomes.
Individual outcomes cannot be predicted, but they can be measured.
In finance, prices are not useful random variables because they depend on scale and drift over time.
Returns are useful random variables because they normalize performance and allow comparison across assets.
Returns change from day to day, but their statistical behavior can be studied over many observations.
Any assumption about return distributions is a model choice, not a guarantee of reality.
